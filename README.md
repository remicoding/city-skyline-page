# City Skyline

This repository contains the HTML and CSS for the **Learn CSS Variables by Building a City Skyline** course by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/).

CSS variables help organize styles and reuse them easily.

The `index.html` file contains HTML tags and appropriate classes to use to structure and manipulate the elements on the page.

The `css/styles.css` file is used with an emphasis on CSS variables. The project allows one to learn how to configure CSS variables so they can be reused whenever needed. In the end, the CSS variables are used in this project to build a city skyline that changes color as the device's screen size changes.
